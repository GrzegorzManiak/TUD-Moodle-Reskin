# TUD-Moodle-Reskin
Moodle reskin for the Technical University of Dublin Tallaght Campus, the original theme was created by [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), and looked horrible, so I decided to make it look better.

## Installation

2: Chrome users: Go to `chrome://extensions/` and drag the zip file into the page.
2: Firefox users: Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click `Load Temporary Add-on...` and select the zip file.
3: Edge users: Go to `edge://extensions/` and drag the zip file into the page.

4. Go to your moodle page and enjoy the new look.
