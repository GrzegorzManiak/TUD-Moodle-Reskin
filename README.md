# TUD-Moodle-Reskin
Moodle reskin for the Technical University of Dublin Tallaght Campus, the original theme was created by [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), and looked horrible, so I decided to make it look better.

## Installation

1. Download the zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/GrzegorzManiak/TUD-Moodle-Reskin/releases/tag/init) page.

2: Chrome users: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, In the top right corner click on `Developer mode`, then click on `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you downloaded the zip file to.  

2: Firefox users: Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click `Load Temporary Add-on...` and select the zip file.

3: Edge users: Go to `edge://extensions/` and click `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you downloaded the zip file to.  

4. Go to your moodle page and enjoy the new look.
