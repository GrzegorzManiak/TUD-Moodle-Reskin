# TUD-Moodle-Reskin
Moodle reskin for the Technical University of Dublin Tallaght Campus, the original theme was created by [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), and looked horrible, so I decided to make it look better.

## Updates

Updates will be applied automatically as its just a CSS file, so you don't have to worry about updating it (Unless features are asked for).

2: Chrome users: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, In the top right corner click on `Developer mode`, then click on `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you unzipped the file in.
