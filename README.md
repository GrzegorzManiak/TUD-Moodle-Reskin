# TUD-Moodle-Reskin
Moodle reskin for the Technical University of Dublin Tallaght Campus, the original theme was created by [Moodle](https://moodle.org/), and looked horrible, so I decided to make it look better.

## Updates

Updates will be applied automatically as its just a CSS file, so you don't have to worry about updating it (Unless features are asked for).

## Installation (Addon)

1. Download the zip file from the [releases](https://github.com/GrzegorzManiak/TUD-Moodle-Reskin/releases/tag/init) page.

2: Chrome users: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, In the top right corner click on `Developer mode`, then click on `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you unzipped the file in.  

2: Firefox users: Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click `Load Temporary Add-on...` and select the zip file.

2: Edge users: Go to `edge://extensions/` and click `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you downloaded the zip file to. 

2: Safari users: Go to `Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop menu in menu bar` and click `Develop > Show Extension Builder` and click `+` and select the folder you downloaded the zip file to.

2: Opera users: Go to `opera://extensions/` and click `Load unpacked extension...` and select the folder you downloaded the zip file to.

3. Go to your moodle page and enjoy the new look.

## Installation (Tampermonkey)
1: Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/).

2: Click [here](https://github.com/GrzegorzManiak/TUD-Moodle-Reskin/releases) and scroll down
to the latest Tampermonkey script release and click on the 'tampermonkey.user.js' file.

3: Go to your moodle page and enjoy the new look.

## Automatic Updates

Automatic updates are performed by TamperMonkey and the script it self (CSS Changes only), since I'm not going to get the addon certified for all browsers, I can't do automatic updates for them.

- Tampermonkey: The script will check for updates every 24 hours, and if there is an update, it will automatically update.

- Script: The script pings the **.ver** file on the github repo, and if there is an update, it will automatically update by downloading the new CSS file in the **releases** directory in this repo.
